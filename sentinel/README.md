# Keypoints Detection Project Overview

As an ML-Engineer, I recently embarked on a fascinating project focused on keypoints detection using Sentinel data. I aimed to leverage satellite imagery to identify key points in my hometown, Odesa. In this markdown, I'll share the key details of the project.

## Data Collection

I took the initiative to collect Sentinel data of Odesa, a process that involved obtaining satellite imagery capturing various aspects of the city. This data served as the foundation for the keypoints detection task.

## Data Annotation

To prepare the dataset for keypoints detection, I chose to annotate the Sentinel data in COCO format. To streamline this annotation process, I utilized the [coco-annotator](https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator.git) tool. This web-based annotation tool allowed for efficient and accurate labeling of keypoints directly on the satellite images.

## Implementation Challenges

While the data collection and annotation phases went smoothly, the subsequent implementation of the keypoints detection model proved to be challenging. Due to time constraints, I faced difficulty in achieving the desired model performance. Recognizing the importance of delivering high-quality results, I made the decision to redirect my efforts toward another task where I could make a more significant impact.

## Conclusion

In the world of machine learning, acknowledging project constraints is crucial. While I was unable to fully realize the keypoints detection model for Sentinel data in this iteration, the experience gained from data collection and annotation will undoubtedly contribute to future projects. Sometimes, redirecting efforts to a more feasible and impactful task is a strategic decision, and I look forward to applying the lessons learned in future endeavors.
